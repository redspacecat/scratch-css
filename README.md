# scratch-css
Test css files for Scratch.

It doesn't work on every page, just the most common ones. You can do it for another page you find, just use the network tab of your browser devtools to record the css files, change the purple to the --scratch3-main-color and --scratch3-dark-color colors, then change the script accordingly. Make sure to also change urls, if relative urls are used.
